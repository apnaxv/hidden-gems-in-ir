# Hidden Gems in Information Retrieval (IR)

The field of Information Retrieval (IR) has increasingly emphasized personalization, aiming to tailor search results to the unique user preferences and behaviors.

In this work, we develop an Information Retrieval System (IRS) that extends beyond conventional relevance-based retrieval by incorporating deeper personalization techniques. We introduce the concept of Hidden Gems—documents underexposed in traditional rankings but highly valued by niche audiences, identified through high favorites-to-view ratios. Additionally, by constructing user profiles from previously asked questions, our system enables personalized recommendations, suggesting related questions posed by other users.

Through rigorous evaluation using precision, nDCG and MAP, we assess our system’s effectiveness in balancing retrieval accuracy and content diversity, ultimately enhancing the user search experience.
