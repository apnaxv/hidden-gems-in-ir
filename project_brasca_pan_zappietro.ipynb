    "# Hidden Gems in Personalized Information Retrieval  \n",
    "In this project, we aim to build and evaluate an **advanced retrieval model** that can efficiently find relevant documents based on user queries, with a focus on **information retrieval (IR)** and **recommender systems (RS)**.\n",
    "The approach integrates multiple stages, including query expansion, document retrieval, ranking and evaluation using **precision**, **nDCG**, and **MAP** as the primary metrics for assessing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of this work include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Proper handling of input data (questions, answers and queries) through cleaning and normalization techniques.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Indexing and Retrieval**: We employ advanced retrieval models like **BM25** for traditional text-based search and **Bi-Encoder Ranking** with **MiniLM** for an efficient semantic matching.\n",
    "Both techniques are integrated into a **custom RetrieverModel** class, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to different types of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Expansion**: To broaden search results, we leverage **T5-small** to expand queries dynamically, generating variations that help increase the diversity of search results.\n",
    "However, it should be noted that **query expansion** may not always improve relevance, as demonstrated by the evaluation, where the expanded queries did not result in higher precision or MAP scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: The model's retrieval performance is rigorously evaluated using a set of **qrels** (relevance judgments) and **test data**. Evaluation takes place with and without query expansion, showing its potential impact on retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **original implementation** is not just a straightforward application of IR techniques, but rather an advanced setup that integrates also query expansion and deep learning models to ensure better retrieval performance. By evaluating the model with real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach in both traditional and cutting-edge information retrieval tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlighting Our Personal Implementation: Hidden Gems in IR\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project introduces a key innovation in **identifying \"Hidden Gems\"** in Information Retrieval. Hidden Gems refer to documents that may not be highly ranked in traditional search engines but possess significant relevance and value when analyzed through deeper, personalized, search techniques. They can be viewed as documents appreciated by niche audiences but underexposed to a broader user base, characterized by high favorites-to-view ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we focus on extracting these Hidden Gems by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalized Ranking**: By applying **deep semantic matching** via **Bi-Encoder Ranking** with **MiniLM**, we can more accurately identify documents that may have lower traditional search rankings but offer high relevance to specific user needs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Expanded Query Search**: The integration of **query expansion** via **T5-small** generates variations of the original query, potentially surfacing more diverse and previously overlooked results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **original implementation** of identifying Hidden Gems is a unique aspect of this project, leveraging both traditional and advanced deep learning techniques to provide more personalized and relevant search results."
